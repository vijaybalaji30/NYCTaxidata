Instructions for running code:
1. The coding has been performed in RStudio.
2. The shapefile and lookup file must be in the working directory of your Rstudio session
3. Please install all the packages specified in the code
4. The summary statistics have fairly self-explanatory names. If you wish to review them please type the name of the variable out in the Rstudio console.

Ideas I would have liked to implement with more time and resources in hand:
1. I could not perform cross validation for my predictive modeling as my laptop cannot handle such computations.
2. Given more time, I would have liked to dive deeper into spatial analysis as it is something completely new for me. Upon research, I found that though R supports spatial analysis,
   there are far better tools available for the same purpose.
3. I currently do not have access to a connector between QlikView and R, otherwise I would have liked to link up the data to QlikView and make some charts.
